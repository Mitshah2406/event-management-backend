## Major Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. Concurrency & Race Condition Handling

**Design Decision**: Multi-layered concurrency control using Redis-based atomic operations and PostgreSQL optimistic locking.

**Implementation**:

- **Redis Lua Scripts**: Atomic seat holding operations that prevent race conditions at the application layer
- **Optimistic Locking**: Version-based conflict resolution for booking updates using database-level versioning
- **TTL-based Holds**: Temporary seat reservations with automatic expiration (10 minutes) to prevent indefinite locks

**Trade-offs**:

- **Pro**: Eliminates overselling, handles high concurrency gracefully, provides excellent user experience
- **Con**: Increased complexity, requires Redis dependency, potential for hold expiration edge cases

**Code Example**:

```go
// Atomic seat holding using Lua scripts
func (r *repository) AtomicHoldSeats(ctx context.Context, seatIDs []uuid.UUID, userID, holdID, eventID string, ttl time.Duration) error {
    // Lua script ensures atomicity across multiple seats
    result, err := r.redis.EvalSha(ctx, luaAtomicSeatHold, keys, args...).Result()
    // Prevents race conditions even under extreme concurrent load
}

// Optimistic locking for booking updates
func (r *repository) UpdateWithVersion(ctx context.Context, booking *Booking) error {
    result := tx.Model(booking).
        Where("id = ? AND version = ?", booking.ID, booking.Version).
        Updates(map[string]interface{}{
            "version": gorm.Expr("version + 1"), // Atomic increment
        })

    if result.RowsAffected == 0 {
        return fmt.Errorf("booking was modified by another process during update")
    }
}
```

### 2. Database Architecture & Schema Design

**Design Decision**: PostgreSQL with carefully designed indexes and constraints, complemented by Redis for high-speed operations.

**Key Features**:

- **Composite Unique Constraints**: Prevent double-booking at database level (`seat_id`, `event_id` unique constraint)
- **Optimized Indexes**: Concurrent index creation for performance during high load
- **Version Control**: Built-in optimistic locking with automatic version incrementing
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints with cascade operations for data consistency

**Schema Highlights**:

```sql
-- Prevent double booking at database level
ALTER TABLE seat_bookings
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_seat_event UNIQUE (seat_id, event_id);

-- Performance optimization for booking queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bookings_user_status ON bookings (user_id, status);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_bookings_id_version ON bookings (id, version);
```

**Trade-offs**:

- **Pro**: ACID compliance, strong consistency, excellent query performance, data integrity
- **Con**: Vertical scaling limitations, potential for lock contention under extreme load

### 3. Caching & Performance Strategy

**Design Decision**: Multi-tier caching with Redis serving as both cache and atomic operation coordinator.

**Implementation**:

- **Seat Availability Cache**: Real-time seat status with automatic invalidation
- **Session Management**: JWT token validation and user session state
- **Hold Management**: Temporary seat reservations with TTL-based expiration
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections (100 max, 10 idle)

**Cache Patterns**:

```go
// Cache-aside pattern for seat availability
func (s *service) GetAvailableSeats(ctx context.Context, sectionID string) ([]Seat, error) {
    cacheKey := fmt.Sprintf("seats:available:%s", sectionID)

    // Try cache first
    if cached, err := s.cache.Get(ctx, cacheKey); err == nil {
        return cached, nil
    }

    // Fallback to database
    seats, err := s.repo.GetAvailableSeatsInSection(ctx, sectionID)
    if err == nil {
        s.cache.Set(ctx, cacheKey, seats, constants.CACHE_TTL_SEATS)
    }

    return seats, err
}
```

## Scalability & Fault Tolerance Approach

### 1. Horizontal Scaling Design

**Stateless Architecture**:

- JWT-based authentication eliminates server-side session dependencies
- Database connection pooling with automatic failover
- Modular domain-based design prepared for future microservices transition

**Load Distribution**:

- Redis caching for high-performance data access
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Asynchronous processing via Kafka for email notifications

### 2. Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

**Graceful Degradation**:

```go
// Service continues operating even if Redis is unavailable
func (r *repository) AtomicHoldSeats(ctx context.Context, seatIDs []uuid.UUID, userID, holdID, eventID string, ttl time.Duration) error {
    if r.atomicRedis == nil {
        // Fallback to database-only operations
        return r.fallbackHoldSeats(ctx, seatIDs, userID, holdID, eventID, ttl)
    }
    return r.atomicRedis.AtomicHoldSeats(ctx, seatIDs, userID, holdID, eventID, ttl)
}
```

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**:

- Health check endpoints for all critical services
- Automatic service discovery and failover
- Connection timeout and retry mechanisms

**Data Consistency Guarantees**:

- Database transactions ensure atomic operations
- Compensating transactions for distributed operations
- Event sourcing for audit trails and recovery

### 3. Performance Optimizations

**Query Optimization**:

- Section-based seat retrieval reduces query complexity
- Efficient pagination with offset/limit patterns
- Optimized joins with proper indexing strategy

**Memory Management**:

- Connection pooling prevents resource exhaustion
- TTL-based cleanup of temporary data
- Efficient JSON marshaling/unmarshaling

    // Send notifications in parallel
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for _, entry := range entries {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(entry WaitlistEntry) {
            defer wg.Done()
            s.notificationService.SendWaitlistNotification(ctx, entry)
